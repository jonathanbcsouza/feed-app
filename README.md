### Feed App

This is an exercise project from Rocketseat tutorials. The project is a simple feed application where users can post and view posts.

### Technologies Used

- **CSS Modules**: Classes names and animation names are scoped locally by default. This helps us to modularize and compose CSS.
- **date-fns**: A modern JavaScript date utility library, used in this project to handle and format dates.
- **phosphor-react**: A flexible icon family for interfaces, diagrams, presentations â€” whatever, really. We use it in this project to add icons to our user interface.

### Project Setup

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd feed-app`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

Now, you should be able to see the project running at localhost:5173 in your browser.
